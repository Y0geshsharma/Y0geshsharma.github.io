                            <p>The Chiphen Rigpel Digital Champ competition was organized by the education ministry and
                                the
                                Indian multinational skills development company NIIT, for students between classes 8 and
                                12,
                                to showcase their skills and knowledge that they acquired through the Chiphen Rigpel
                                project
                                that was being imparted in various schools and institutes in the country for the past
                                five
                                years.</p>
                            <p>The competition was divided into four groups with students of classes 7-8, 9-10, 11, and
                                12
                                being grouped separately.</p>
                            <p>Biren and Yogesh, class XII students, won the competition by designing a website that
                                provided information about the impact of mobile technology on society.</p>
                            <p>While both had been interested in website design, the course allowed them to pick up
                                HTML,
                                the language used to create and build websites.</p>
                            <p>While Yogesh’s father was able to provide him with a desktop computer, Biren said he did
                                not
                                have one at home. Both of their parents are farmers. Besides the scholarships, the two
                                were
                                also awarded laptop computers.</p>
                            <p>“Of course we will,” a smiling Biren said, on whether they will in fact take up the
                                scholarships and pursue an IT education at NIIT.</p>
                            <p>Winners in other categories also won laptops, while runners up received smart phones and
                                tablets.</p>
                            <p>Punakha HSS were the runners up in the class 12 category.</p>
                            <p>NIIT Global Technology Strategy President, Udai Singh, shared his thoughts on the Chiphen
                                Rigpel project and the contest. “Very rarely does one get to be part of a movement that
                                has
                                the potential to change the fortunes of an entire nation and have a lasting impact on
                                generations to come,” he said. “Children are the future of any nation and with what
                                we’ve
                                seen, the level of participation in the project, and specifically this competition, I
                                can
                                say with some confidence that the future of Bhutan is looking bright,” he added.</p>
                            <p>Udai Singh pointed out that the computer is the most used general tool at our disposal,
                                today. “As responsible citizens, it is our duty to the nation to become competent at
                                using
                                this tool and applying it effectively in a myriad of daily situations,” he said.</p>
                            <p>He pointed out that the students had successfully demonstrated their desire and
                                capability to
                                master the tool as evident by their performance. In the final round of the competition,
                                the
                                students had to perform with a time limit, in addition to applying theoretical knowledge
                                gained during their courses. “All those who’ve participated today are indeed champions,
                                there are no losers over here,” he said.</p>
                            <p>“I’ve often heard that the serene environment and natural beauty of Bhutan, and peaceful
                                culture of Bhutan, was perhaps not conducive to the cut throat competition that is there
                                at
                                the global workplace,” he said, adding that the students had proved otherwise.</p>
                            <p>“This competitive spirit is to be nurtured and I’m hopeful that in its vision for
                                education,
                                the government of Bhutan continues to foster healthy competition through these events
                                and
                                prepares future generations to compete at the global level.”</p>
                            <p>It was also pointed out that NIIT has been supporting the Youth Development Fund over the
                                past three years. At least 12 students have received scholarships and have completed
                                6-12
                                month IT courses at NIIT.</p>
                            <p>Indian ambassador to Bhutan, Gautam Bambawale, guest of honour at the event, explained to
                                the
                                students in attendance how information technology is a “great leveller” and that large
                                amounts of information can now be accessed by anyone, even in the remotest parts of the
                                world, at the click of a button.</p>
                            <p>“The question before you now is how to make optimal use of the huge information resources
                                which are made available to you by these new technologies,” the ambassador said. “Those
                                of
                                you who will be good at accessing, digesting, analyzing and utilizing such information
                                will
                                come out on top,” he added. “You will be the future leaders of Bhutan and the world.”
                            </p>
                            <p>He hoped that the students understood that the tools and powers available to the students
                                were a result of the Chiphen Rigpel project. He suggested that such competitions
                                continue to
                                be held.</p>
                            <p>In the class 11 group, Punakha HSS were the winners for creating and editing a video on
                                the
                                impact of mobile technology on youth, followed by Jampeling HSS in Trashigang.</p>
                            <p>In the class 9-10 group, Orong HSS won for designing a poster that displayed living in
                                harmony with nature. The runners up was Mendrelgang central school.</p>
                            <p>In the 7-8 group, Damphu Lower Secondary School won for creating a power point
                                presentation
                                on the impact of computer based tools on learning. The runners up were Chumey Middle
                                Secondary school.</p>
                            <p>A total of 184 schools took part in the competition, including 16 private ones.</p>
                            <p>More than 100,000 students have been taught skills in office automation, image, video and
                                audio processing, website construction, among several others.</p>
                            <p>The over Nu 2 billion Chiphen Rigpel project, which ends in December, this year, is
                                funded by
                                the Indian government.</p>
